Exercise:
create an interactive one-page feedback page and integrate the API.

Technologies for executing a test task:
1) Reactjs - to create an interface
2) Typescript - for typing
3) Module.css / scss / sass - for styling
4) React HookForm - for collecting data
5) Yup - for validation
6) Nextjs - for SSR



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started Server

First, run the server:

```

yarn server

```

The server for interacting with the API will be running on http:localhost:3004


## Getting Started Fontend

First, run the development server:

```

yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
